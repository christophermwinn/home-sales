# home-sales
Module 22 Challenge

In this challenge, we used our knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. We then used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

Included in this repo is the colab notebook with code utilized for this challenge.
